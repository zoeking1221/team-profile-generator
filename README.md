# team-profile-generator

The Team Profile Generator is designed for managers who are looking to organize their team members. This application uses the command line to allow managers to enter information about their team members. Once complete, the application generates an HTML page that displays each member's information, with links to their emails and Github profiles (where appropriate).

In order to utilize this application, users should follow the below steps:

1. Open the code repository in VS Code
2. Open the command line and run 'npm install' (when you first open the application)
3. Run 'npm run test' to test the application's class functions
4. Run 'node index.js' to start the application
